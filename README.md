# Hey there! I'm Carlos Hallan

## Software Engineer | Creative Technologist | Portuguese Thriller Writer

### About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer fluent in the languages of Python, Javascript/TypeScript, React/VueJS, Rust, and all things adjacent to creative problem-solving. By day, I architect digital solutions; by night, I craft thrillers in Portuguese that keep readers on the edge of their seats.

- **Tech Stack:** Python · TypeScript · React · Vue · Rust · Creative Coding
- **Writer:** Published Portuguese thriller author, weaving suspenseful tales when I'm not building software (chblacksmith.com.br).
- **Creative Mind:** I love blending technology and art—building tools for creators, studios, and storytellers.
